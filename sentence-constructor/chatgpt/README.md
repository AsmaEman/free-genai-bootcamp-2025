# Arabic Sentence Constructor Teaching Assistant

## About This Project
The Arabic Sentence Constructor Teaching Assistant is an interactive language learning tool designed for beginners. It helps students translate English sentences into Arabic by guiding them through the process of constructing sentences step by step. The tool focuses on building essential skills such as vocabulary extraction, understanding basic sentence structure, and considering common translation challenges.

## Model Details
This project is powered by ChatGPT, a large language model based on OpenAIâ€™s GPT-4 architecture. The model is capable of:
- Extracting key vocabulary from the input sentence.
- Outlining a basic sentence structure using placeholders (e.g., [Subject] [Verb] [Object] [Time]).
- Providing clues and considerations related to word order, verb conjugation, gender agreement, and the placement of adjectives.
- Offering supportive and guiding feedback without revealing full translations, encouraging learners to think through the process independently.

## How It Works
1. **Input:**  
   The student provides an English sentence that they want to translate into Arabic.

2. **Processing:**  
   The assistant analyzes the sentence to extract key vocabulary and suggests a basic sentence structure suitable for beginner-level Arabic. It then offers hints and guiding questions to help the student work toward the correct translation.

3. **Guidance:**  
   - **Vocabulary Table:** Lists essential words (nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs) with their Arabic form, transliteration, and English meaning.
   - **Sentence Structure:** Provides a simplified outline (using placeholders) that shows the expected word order without final grammatical details.
   - **Clues and Considerations:** Offers focused hints about vocabulary selection, word order, and common challenges in translating into Arabic.

## Instructions for Use
- **Step 1:** Submit an English sentence to be translated.
- **Step 2:** Review the provided vocabulary table and sentence structure outline.
- **Step 3:** Work through the translation by considering the clues and hints. If needed, submit your translation attempt to receive feedback and further guidance.

## Prompt Overview
A specialized prompt was designed to instruct the model to:
- Assume the role of an Arabic language teacher for beginners.
- Guide the student through the translation process by providing structured assistance (vocabulary, sentence structure, and clues).
- Avoid providing the complete translation directly, instead empowering the student to arrive at the answer independently.
