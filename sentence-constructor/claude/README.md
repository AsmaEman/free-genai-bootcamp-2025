Output:
```
Vocabulary You'll Need:
Arabic         | Transliteration | English  | Urdu
القِطَّة        | al-qiṭṭa       | cat      | بلی
نَائِمَة        | nā'ima         | sleeping | سو رہی ہے
الحَدِيقَة      | al-ḥadīqa      | garden   | باغ
فِي           | fī             | in       | میں

Sentence Structure:
• Arabic: [Subject] + [Adjective/State] + [Location]
• English: "The cat is sleeping in the garden"
• Urdu: "بلی باغ میں سو رہی ہے"

Let's Build It:
القِطَّة (the cat) + نَائِمَة (sleeping) + فِي الحَدِيقَة (in the garden)

Final sentence: القِطَّة نَائِمَة فِي الحَدِيقَة

Grammar Tips:
• نَائِمَة ends with ة because القِطَّة is feminine
• We use فِي for "in" with places
• Notice how الحَدِيقَة has الـ (the) at the beginning
```
